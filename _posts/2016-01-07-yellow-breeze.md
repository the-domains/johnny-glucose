Yellow breeze of sweet heavy cream,

Dampens further the dull left-over,

Exhausted breath from twisted terror, 

Under clouds of nausea, was for fun.

Days of waste make up the bedding,

Head left dangling from lack of wanting,

The bounce is thick of no small wonder,

Or search or wonder of sunlight clean.

The kill is on forming furry

Pour me slowly out on the wind

Pushing stream, tearing to tear drops

And going, scattering, mixing with time

Gone
in the way I knew how
